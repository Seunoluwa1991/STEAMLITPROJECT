Project Guideline for Educational Website

1. Project Overview

Project Name: (Choose a suitable name, e.g., "EduTech Hub")

Description: A modern educational platform designed to engage learners through interactive lessons, project-based learning, and real-world applications.

Target Audience: Students, educators, and lifelong learners.

Primary Colors: White, Orange, and Yellow (aligning with the educational theme).

Goals:

Provide high-quality educational resources in coding, mathematics, and STEAM subjects.

Offer interactive learning modules and project-based activities.

Enable educators to create and manage courses.

Implement a student progress tracking system.

2. Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js (with Bootstrap for styling)

Backend: Node.js with Express.js

Database: MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)

Authentication: Firebase Authentication / JWT

Hosting: Vercel for frontend, Render/Heroku for backend

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Other Tools:

Postman (for API testing)

Redux/Zustand (for state management)

WebRTC / Video API (for live classes)

3. Development Phases

Phase 1: Planning & Setup

Define user roles (Students, Educators, Admins).

Design UI/UX wireframes and course structure.

Set up GitHub repository and project board.

Phase 2: Frontend Development

Develop key pages:

Home Page: Introduction & featured courses.

Course Catalog: Browse and filter courses.

Course Page: Lessons, videos, and quizzes.

Dashboard: Progress tracking and user profile.

Admin Panel: Manage users and content.

Implement React Router for seamless navigation.

Phase 3: Backend Development

Set up Express.js with API routes:

User Authentication: Signup/login with Firebase/JWT.

Course Management: Create, update, delete courses.

Progress Tracking: Store and update user progress.

Quiz & Assignments: Store scores and responses.

Phase 4: Database & Storage

Design MongoDB schema for users, courses, progress tracking.

Use Firebase Storage for video lectures and materials.

Phase 5: Interactive Features

Discussion Forum (Real-time chat for student-educator interaction).

Gamification (Badges, leaderboards, and certificates).

Live Classes (WebRTC or Zoom integration).

Phase 6: Testing & Debugging

Conduct unit testing with Jest for frontend & backend.

Test API functionality using Postman.

Debug UI/UX and fix performance issues.

Phase 7: Deployment & Maintenance

Deploy frontend on Vercel and backend on Render/Heroku.

Configure custom domain & SSL security.

Set up monitoring tools (Google Analytics, Firebase Crashlytics).

Plan for future updates and course expansions.

4. Best Practices

Responsive Design: Ensure mobile and desktop compatibility.

Clean Code & Modular Structure: Follow best coding practices (DRY, SOLID).

Security Measures: Use JWT for authentication, input validation, and database security.

Version Control: Implement Git branching strategy (main, develop, feature branches).
